<h1>Jabberwocky</h1>
<p>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves <br>
    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
    All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
    And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>

<p>“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br>
    The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
    Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
    The frumious Bandersnatch!”</p>

<p>  He took his <b>vorpal sword</b> in hand;<br>
    Long time the manxome foe he sought—<br>
    So rested he by the Tumtum tree<br>
    And stood awhile in thought.</p>

<p> And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
    The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br>
    Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
    And burbled as it came!</p>

<p><sub>One</sub>, <sup>two</sup>! <sub>One</sub>, <sup>two</sup>! And through and through<br>
    The <b>vorpal blade</b> went snicker-snack!<br>
    He left it dead, and with its head<br>
    He went galumphing back.</p>

<p>“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>
    Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
    O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”<br>
    He chortled in his joy.</p>

<p>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
    All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
    And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
